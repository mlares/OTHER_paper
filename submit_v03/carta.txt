Dear Referee,

Thank you for your honest review of our manuscript.  It allowed us to find
the weaknesses in the description of our work and to perform a detailed
reformulation of both the text and the experiment.

After the changes we made following your suggestions, we expect it is more
clear and better presented.  In summary, this new version is focused on the
formal description and a clear presentation of the model, the experiment and
the conclusions. We have also developed an updated version of our code, which
allowed us to perform a more complete experimental setting where we can
explore new regions in the parameter space.

We have also modified the Figures and the arrangement of the sections in order
to stregthen the description of the model.


In what follows we detail the changes with respect to the former version of
the manuscript:
 

Writting
--------

We have revised the text on a word by word basis, using tools to check for
grammar, style and readability. We have also restructured the text aiming at a
better development of the ideas and trying to deliver a smoothed out writting.
Also, we have made the manuscript read by colleagues and made changes on the
portions of the text that were less easily understood.
 

Software
--------

We have completely rewritten the code following several standards of 
software engineering to build metrics for code quality assurance.

The package, now dubbed HEARSAY, is publically available through a GitHub
repository and has a detailed documentation on a readthedocs page, which is
standard for python projects.  A new functionality has been added that allows to
perform parallel computations and take advantage of computational clusters.

The documentation has guided tutorials to make simple runs of the simulations
with a few lines of code, and to have a sense on the time required for a suite
of simulations on any hardware setting.

The new results were obtained using the Clemente cluster at the Instituto de Astronomía
Teórica y Experimental (IATE), on a batch job comprising 50 cores, after four days.

Experimental setting
--------------------

We have expanded the range of the parameters with respect to the previous
version. The new region of the parameter that has been explored comprise the
following grid:

tau_awakening:
21 bins in the range 500 a to 40500 a, plus 51 bins in the 
range 5.e5 a to 1.e6 a.

By extension, these values are (in years):

500.,  2500.,  4500.,  6500.,  8500., 10500., 12500., 14500.,
16500., 18500., 20500., 22500., 24500., 26500., 28500., 30500.,
32500., 34500., 36500., 38500., 40500.,
50000.,   69000.,   88000.,  107000.,  126000.,  145000.,
164000.,  183000.,  202000.,  221000.,  240000.,  259000.,
278000.,  297000.,  316000.,  335000.,  354000.,  373000.,
392000.,  411000.,  430000.,  449000.,  468000.,  487000.,
506000.,  525000.,  544000.,  563000.,  582000.,  601000.,
620000.,  639000.,  658000.,  677000.,  696000.,  715000.,
734000.,  753000.,  772000.,  791000.,  810000.,  829000.,
848000.,  867000.,  886000.,  905000.,  924000.,  943000.,
962000.,  981000., 1000000.

The reason of this choice is that the software is prepared to run on
linear grids, so that we had to combine a coarse grain grid for large values
with a finer grid for small values.  We plan to allow for a modification
of this restriction on future versions of the code.

tau_survive:
The same values of the tau_awakening parameters, namely:
21 bins in the range 500 a to 40500 a, plus 51 bins in the 
range 5.e5 a to 1.e6 a.

D_max:
100 pc, 500 pc, 1 kpc, 5 kpc and 10 kpc.


Given the wide range of values for the analysed parameters, 
we do not show the full range in all the figures, but only sample models that
clearly exhibit relevant trends.


We have also changed the region defined as the Galactic Habitable Zone,
in order to follow the values in the bibliography.
