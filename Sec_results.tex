\section{Results: exploring the parameter space}\label{S_results}
%{{{

We implemented the simulation of a regular grid of models varying over
the hypothesis space, which covers 15000 different models.
%
For each model, we simulated 50 realizations with different random
seeds, in order to perform a MonteCarlo estimation of the variance.
%
The parameters for the temporal aspects of the simulation (the mean
waiting time for the next awakening, $\left<\tau_a\right>$, and the
mean lifetime, $\left<\tau_s\right>$) cover the ranges 4000-200000 yr
and 10000-500000 yr, respectively, with a regular partition of 50
values for each parameter.
%
For the D$_{max}$ parameter, we chose the values 500, 1000, 10000,
20000, 40000 and 80000 lyr.
%
This setup makes a total of 750000 simulations, each covering a time
range of one million years.
%
\ttn{1}
%
In Table \ref{T_simu_hypotheses} we show the three variable
parameters, the ranges of their values and the number of bins that
have been explored in the numerical experiments.
%
We also show the set of parameters that take part in the simulation,
their values and the hypotheses that define the runs of the
simulations.




As a product of the simulations, several quantities can be obtained.
%
Some quantities are directly derived from the discrete events, namely,
the ID of emitting and receiving \cetis{}, the position in the galaxy, and
the times of each of the events that are relevant to keep track of the
number of \cetis{} (time of awakening and time of doomsday) and of the
number of contacts (the times of contacts and the times of blackouts).
%
We can also derive the additional quantities that represent the
properties of the \cetis{}, for example the total time elapsed between the
awakening and the doomsday of each \ceti{}.
%
The time span of a \ceti{} listening another or being listened by another
can also be easily derived from the results of a realization.
%
This way we can also compute the distribution in the galaxy of
\cetis{}
that reach contact and the waiting time until the first contact or the
waiting time until the next contact.
%
Regarding the properties of the population of \cetis{} and its evolution,
the simulation yields the fraction of awaken time a \ceti{} is listening
at least another \ceti{} (i.e., in their causal cone), the age of
contacted \cetis{} at first contact, the distribution of time to wait
until next contact, the fraction of \cetis{} where the first contact is
given at the awakening, the distribution of the number of contacts for
each \ceti{}, the distribution of the number of contacts as a function of
\ceti{} age, the number of contacts as a function of time in the galaxy,
the rate of \cetis{} that succeed in contact, and the distribution of
distances between contacted \cetis{}.
%
Another useful derived quantity is the duration of two-way
communication channels or the fraction of contacts that admit a
response.
% 
It is also possible to analyze the relations between the distance to
\ceti{} vs. the time of double communication, the distance to \ceti{} vs. the
age of contacted \ceti{}, the age of a \ceti{} and the maximum number of
contacted \cetis{} before doomsday, or the lifespan of a \ceti{} vs. the
maximum number of contacts.
%
In addition, all these quantities can be analyzed as a function of the
simulation parameters.
%
We chose eight models that are on fairly opposed regions of the
explored parameter space, and cover short/long lifetimes, short/long
waiting times for the next \ceti{} to appear in the Galaxy and short/large
range reach of the signal, including all possible combinations.
%
\ttn{2}
%
The details of each model are summarized in the
Table~\ref{T_selected_models}.


\ffn{3}
%
In Fig.~\ref{F_number_of_contacts} we show the Empirical cumulative
distributions of the number contacts for \cetis{} in four different
samples (M5, M6, M7, M8) with long range signal reach
(D$_{max}$=10000). 
%
The lifetime is more determinant than the awakening rate in increasing
the number of contacts.
%
As expected, of the four samples, the sample M7, which corresponds to
a dense awakening in the timeline and a long lifetime, is the model
that maximizes the number of contacts, reaching a maximum of order 100
contacts for a single \ceti{}.
%
This is considerable larger than any model with a shorter lifetime,
which produce a number of contacts of at most the order of ten
contacts per \ceti{}.
%
A couple of comments are worth to mention about this plot.
%
First, it has a logarithmic scale on the x-axis, and second it is the
cumulative, not differential, empirical distribution.
 

In what follows, we focus on the analysis of the duration of contacts
(Sec.~\ref{SS_multiplicity}), the waiting time for the first contact
(Sec.~\ref{SS_waiting}) and the
variations of contact possibilities as a function of the position of
the \ceti{} in the Galaxy (Sec.~\ref{SS_location}).

\subsection{Membership to the network of connected \cetis{}}\label{SS_members}

%{{{
\ffn{4, 5}
%
We show the 2D maps of the rate of \cetis{} that never make contact and
the rate of \cetis{} that make contact at the moment of the awakening,
in the Figs.~\ref{F_never_contact} and \ref{F_C_at_A}, respectively,
as a function of $\tau_s$ and $\tau_s$.

\subsection{Waiting time for a first contact}\label{SS_waiting}
%{{{

In this section we analyze the distribution of the waiting times for
a first contact.
%
%Such distribution can be considered to compute the probability of
%reaching a first contact within the first XX years of a SETI project,
%assuming the methods are correct and the hypotheses of the experiment.
Such distribution can be considered to compute the probability for a
random \ceti{} to carry out a SETI project and spend a given time until
the first contact is made. 

\ffn{6}
%
In the Fig.~\ref{F_waiting_for_1C} we show the histograms of the mean
waiting times for the first contact, for several models.
%
Left panel shows the histograms for several values of $\tau_a$, and
$\tau_s$ in the range 17000-24000 yr.
%
Right panel shows the histograms for several values of $\tau_s$, and
$\tau_a$ in the range 68000-100000 yr.
%
The shape of the histograms does not change when $\tau_a$ is modified,
but significantly changes when $\tau_s$ is modified. 


In the Fig.~\ref{F_waiting_for_1C} we show the fraction of the
\cetis{}
that have made at least one contact as a function of the elapsed time
since the awakening, given that they make at least one contact on
their lifetime, for different models.
%
From a frequentist approach, the normalized cumulative counts are
related to the estimation of the probability of observing a given time
with no success.
%             
Both panels show the histograms of the waiting times for the first
contact, for all the \cetis{} that make at least one contact along their
lifetime.
%
We show separately the histograms for several values of $\tau_a$ and a
fixed value of $(\tau_s, D_{max})$, and for several values of $\tau_s$
and a fixed value of $(\tau_a, D_{max})$.
%
For different values of $\tau_a$, the shape of the distribution is
similar, and the main difference given by the different number of
contacts on the different models.
%
Conversely, for different values of $\tau_a$, the shape of the
distribution is similar, and the main difference given by the
different number of contacts on the different models.

\subsection{Location within the Galaxy}\label{SS_location}
%{{{
    
%On the Figure~\ref{F_radial_frac} we show the fraction of \cetis{} that
%make zero, one, two or three contacts, as a function of the
%galactocentric distance, for model M1.  VERIFICAR!  M1?
%
For this model, the majority of \cetis{} do not make any contact during
all the time period in which they are active.
%
As expected, the fractions of \cetis{} making at least one contact
diminishes as the number of contacts rises.
%
The shape of this distribution is a result of the geometry of the GHZ.
%
In general, a closer position to the center of the Galaxy slightly
favours the possibility of a contact.
%
This would indicate that the position of the Earth is suitable for the
odds of making a contact.
