The abundance of intelligent civilizations in the Galaxy is a longstanding
question, often conceptualized as the problem of the lack of received
communication. Most efforts on the estimation of a number of civilizations are
focused on the Drake equation, although its factors are affected by large
uncertainties and it lacks a temporal nature.  Alternative approaches use
detailed numerical simulations of the galaxy and recipes for the stars and
planets formation rates and for the origin of life, and rely on highly
uncertain parameters. We present a statistical model for the abundance and
duration of civilizations, implemented through Monte Carlo simulations.  We
explore the hypothesis space of the model by a suite of simulations for the
emergence of communicating nodes, and analyze their
causal connections.  This is based on minimal assumptions and three
free parameters, with focus on the statistical properties of empirical
models instead of an interpretable model with variables to be determined by
observation. The analysis of the rate of causal contacts as a function of the
mean number of civilizations, the mean lifespan distribution and the maximum
distance a civilization can send signals is presented, and used as a framework
to discuss the spatial and temporal structure of a populated galaxy within
several scenarios. We find that, given the large distances involved,
causal contacts between civilizations are very rare. Additionally, the odds to
make a contact in a few years of monitoring are low for most models, with the
exception of those of a galaxy densely populated with long lived
civilizations. The probability of causal contacts increases with the
lifetime of civilizations much more significantly than with the number of
active civilizations for a given time window. Finally, we show that the
maximum probability of making a contact occurs when a civilization acquires
the required communication technology.
