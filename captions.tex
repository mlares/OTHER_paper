%_______________________________________________________________
\definecaption{F_scheme}{%
%
Space--time diagrams showing a schematic representation of the
different stages in the development of a communicating civilization,
the growing communicating sphere (a) and the temporal intervals for
the communication between two civilizations (b).
%
In the upper panel (a), the sphere the encloses the region which is
causally connected to the emitter grows until it reaches the
$D_{max}$ distance.  After the $D$ event, that region is limited by
the surface of last contact.
%
The scheme in the lower panel (b) represents two communicating
civilizations that have causal contact in both directions
%
}

%_______________________________________________________________
\definecaption{F_messages}{%
%   
Schematic representation of the possible cases in which a
ceti A can be in causal contact with a ceti B which appears later.
%   
The duration of the causal contact in one direction depends on
several factors, mainly $\Delta t_A$, $\Delta t_C$, and $\Delta X$.
%   
}

%_______________________________________________________________
\definecaption{F_number_of_contacts}{%
%
Empirical cumulative distributions of the number contacts
for MPLs in four different samples (M5, M6, M7, M8) with long
range signal reach (D$_{max}$=10000).
%
}


%_______________________________________________________________
\definecaption{F_never_contact}{%
%
Rate of MPLs that never make contact (listening) as a
function of $\tau_a$ and $\tau_s$, for 
$D_{max}$=10000 (left panel),
$D_{max}$=40000 (middle panel), and
$D_{max}$=80000 (right panel)
%
}



%_______________________________________________________________
\definecaption{F_C_at_A}{%
%
Rate of MPLs that listen at the moment of the
awakening, as a funcion of $\tau_a$ and $\tau_s$, for
$D_{max}$=10000 (left panel),
$D_{max}$=40000 (middle panel), and
$D_{max}$=80000 (right panel)
%
} 


%_______________________________________________________________
\definecaption{F_waiting_for_1C}{%
%
Histograms of the mean waiting times for the first contact, for
several models.
%
Left panel shows the histograms for several values of $\tau_a$, and
$\tau_s$ in the range 17000-24000 yr.
%
Right panel shows the histograms for several values of $\tau_s$, and
$\tau_a$ in the range 68000-100000 yr.
%
The shape of the histograms does not change when $\tau_a$ is
modified, but significantly changes when $\tau_s$ is modified.
