Dear editor, 

please consider our manuscript
entitled "Probability of causal
contact between interstellar civilizations through MonteCarlo simulations"
for publication on Astrobiology.

In this work, we address the problem of the contact between intelligent civilizations 
in the Galaxy from a statistical point of view, using simulations to compute
the probability of contact as a function of a small number of parameters in our model.


We confirm that this work is original and has not been published nor it is
currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.
